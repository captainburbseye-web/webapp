# CRS DESIGN GOVERNANCE BRIEFING — FOR SIGNAGE AGENT

**Date:** January 12, 2026  
**Context:** Manufacturing audit incoming + signage material must align with live website  
**Project:** Cowley Road Studios (CRS) — cowleyroadstudios.com  
**Recipient:** Signage/Print Design Agent

---

## 🔒 CORE GOVERNANCE PRINCIPLES (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

### 1. RESTRAINT OVER EXPRESSION

**Rule:** Authority through discipline, not decoration.

- **NO** gradients
- **NO** decorative animations (print can't animate anyway)
- **NO** illustrative metaphors
- **NO** multiple competing visual statements
- **NO** "clever dashboard" energy

**Instead:**
- Clean typography
- Flat color blocks
- Functional hierarchy
- Single visual assertion per piece

---

### 2. HARDWARE RACK LANGUAGE (PRIMARY VISUAL SYSTEM)

**Reference:** Physical studio equipment, broadcast consoles, Reason DAW interface  
**NOT:** Cyberpunk, gaming UI, neon glow effects

**Visual Characteristics:**
- Dark backgrounds (#0A0A0A to #1a1a1a)
- Neutral borders (#3a3a3a to #4a4a4a)
- Rack-unit containment (one parent frame, no overlapping borders)
- Tactile, legible, calm
- Industrial without being cold

**Typography:**
- **Primary:** JetBrains Mono (monospace, technical authority)
- **Accent:** Archivo Black (headings only, used sparingly)
- **Body:** Inter (weights: 400, 600, 700)

**Sizes:**
- Small (0.68–0.75rem / ~11–12px) — authority through compression
- Never over-scale to compensate — use letter-spacing instead

---

### 3. COLOR PALETTE (LOCKED)

**Primary Colors:**
- **CRS Green (VU Green):** #39FF14 (bright) / #2d8a1f (muted)
- **Mustard Gold (Café):** #D4A017 (bright) / #b8860b (brass/muted)
- **Signal Red (AV):** #C41E3A (bright) / #8b1a1a (oxide/muted)
- **Dark Base:** #0A0A0A (deep black) / #1a1a1a (rack grey)
- **Neutral Borders:** #3a3a3a / #4a4a4a
- **Off-White Text:** #c0c0c0 (idle) / #ffffff (active)

**Color Usage Rules:**
- **Idle states:** Muted colors only (darker variants)
- **Active/Highlight:** Bright colors (solid blocks, no glow)
- **NO full neon at rest** — neon is earned through interaction/emphasis

**Color-Coding by Function:**
- Studio → Green
- Workshop Café / Venue → Mustard/Amber
- AV Services → Red
- General/Infrastructure → Mustard accent

---

### 4. BRANDING ASSETS (APPROVED)

**Primary Logo:**
- Dark CRS logo with control panel graphic
- URL: `https://www.genspark.ai/api/files/s/hItia3i9`
- Use this for: Print materials, signage, footer

**Control Panel Motif:**
- TASCAM-style control panel (Studios branding)
- URL: `https://pub-991d8d2677374c528678829280f50c98.r2.dev/CRS-Buttons%20ready%20for%20web/crs-control-panel-studios.png`
- Use this for: Atmospheric separators, system authority contexts
- **NOT a logo** — it's a visual motif/system element

**Favicon/Stamp Icon:**
- CRS stamp icon
- URL: `https://pub-991d8d2677374c528678829280f50c98.r2.dev/CRS-Buttons%20ready%20for%20web/crs-favicon-stamp.png`
- Use this for: Small marks, badges, stamps

**Workshop Café Marquee:**
- Glowing marquee logo (used on café page only)
- Has its own treatment — ask before using elsewhere

---

### 5. INFRASTRUCTURE AS STRUCTURAL CENTRE OF GRAVITY

**Critical Concept:** CRS is a coordinated system, not siloed services.

**Language to Use:**
- "Coordinated infrastructure"
- "Shared systems"
- "Multi-location operation"
- "Signal routing"
- "Networked audio/video"

**Language to AVOID:**
- "Services" (too marketing)
- "Offerings" (too boutique)
- "Packages" (too commercial)
- "Solutions" (too corporate)

**Dual-Location System:**
- **118 Cowley Road** — HQ & Technical Brain
  - Recording, mixing, production
  - Booth dry hire
  - Podcasting
  - Repairs & diagnostics
  - Workshop Café / Venue
  
- **Cricket Road** — Rehearsal Node
  - Band rehearsals
  - High-decibel sessions
  - Equipment storage
  - Loud tracking

---

### 6. TONE & VOICE (CRITICAL)

**Institutional Authority, Not Hype:**
- Calm, declarative statements
- Operational truth over marketing promises
- "This is" not "Imagine if"
- Spec sheet logic, not sales copy

**Examples:**

✅ **CORRECT:**
```
STUDIO SYSTEMS: CONTROL / LIVE ROOMS / NETWORKED AUDIO
PUBLIC INTERFACE: CAFÉ / VENUE / FRONT-OF-HOUSE
TECHNICAL OPS: AV DEPLOYMENT / REPAIR / DIAGNOSTICS

COORDINATED FROM: 118 COWLEY ROAD
```

❌ **INCORRECT:**
```
🎵 YOUR CREATIVE JOURNEY STARTS HERE! 🎵
Unlock unlimited possibilities with our state-of-the-art facilities!
Book now and experience the magic of sound! ✨
```

---

### 7. HIERARCHY RULES

**Primary (Loudest):**
- CRS logo / identity
- BOOK NOW (only interactive CTA that pulses)

**Secondary (Structural Authority):**
- Infrastructure snapshot
- System coordination messaging
- Dual-location information

**Tertiary (Supportive):**
- Service descriptions
- Contact info
- Navigation

**Never Compete:**
- One visual assertion per piece
- Infrastructure panel should feel heavier than hero, but not louder

---

## 🎯 SUCCESS CRITERIA

**A viewer should think:**
> "This is a real, coordinated, operational organization."

**NOT:**
> "This is a creative studio trying to look cool."

---

## 🧠 STRATEGIC NOTE (WHY THIS MATTERS)

**Context:** Manufacturing audit incoming means external scrutiny of brand consistency.

**Goal:** Every touchpoint (website, signage, print) should feel like it came from the same operational system, not different marketing departments.

**Award Jury Logic:** Design-literate viewers recognize:
- Discipline over decoration
- Operational truth over marketing promises
- Authority through restraint
- One structural assertion, executed perfectly

**This is how you win awards and audits — coherence, not creativity.**
