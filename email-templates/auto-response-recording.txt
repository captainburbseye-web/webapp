Subject: Your CRS Enquiry - Recording & Pricing Information

Hi {name},

Thanks for getting in touch about recording at Cowley Road Studios!

We're currently finishing the build on our main Cowley Road facility (opening March 2026), but we have two ways to get you recording:

**Record immediately (Cricket Road):**
We can get you in right away at our Cricket Road space. It's a great setup for recording work and we guarantee a top-tier result.

**Early Bird Ticket (Cowley Road):**
You can prepay for a session at the new Cowley Road studio for when it opens (no later than March 2026). Since we're still finishing the build, we're offering these at discounted rates.

**Current Pricing:**
- Recording & Production (with Engineer): £35/hour (2-hour minimum) | £130 for 4 hours
- Dry Hire (Self-sufficient users): Cowley Road: £70/2hrs, £130/4hrs, £300/day | Cricket Road: £50/2hrs, £90/4hrs, £200/day
- First-time dry hire users: £30 one-off induction session required

I've attached our full 2026 Rate Card with all services and pricing.

Do you have a specific deadline for your project, or would you like to grab one of the Early Bird deals?

Best,
Cowley Road Studios
