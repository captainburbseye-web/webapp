## 🎯 Next Steps

### Option A: Implement All Remaining Pages Now
I'll update /studio, /contact, /workshop-cafe, and /av-services with the full content from your markdown files. This will take 15-20 minutes.

### Option B: Prioritize Studio & Contact Pages
Focus on the two highest-priority pages (/studio and /contact) first since these drive bookings directly.

### Option C: Review Homepage First
You check the live homepage at https://cowleyroadstudios.com to make sure you're happy with it, then I'll proceed with the subpages.
