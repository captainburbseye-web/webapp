# CRS × WORKSHOP CAFÉ
# "NO CHAOS" TECHNICAL POLICY
## External Promoters, Engineers & Event Hosts

**Status: ACTIVE — ENFORCED**

Cowley Road Studios & Workshop Café operates a heritage-forward, precision-calibrated audio-visual system. To protect equipment, neighbours, artists, and long-term system integrity, the following rules apply to all external events, promoters, DJs, engineers, and collectives.

---

## 1. SYSTEM AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

CRS technical staff have final authority over:
- PA configuration
- Gain structure
- Speaker placement
- Limiting levels
- Signal routing

External engineers may not override system settings without approval.

**If CRS technical staff decline a request, that decision is final.**

---

## 2. FRONT-OF-HOUSE PA (BOSE 802 + MARTIN IC300)

This system is calibrated for clarity, not brute force.

**You MAY:**
- Plug into designated inputs provided by CRS
- Request minor tonal adjustments
- Use CRS-provided DI / interfaces

**You MAY NOT:**
- Bypass limiters
- Repatch amps or processors
- Daisy-chain additional speakers
- Add external subs
- Push system into audible distortion
- "Redline it because it's a party"

**If audible distortion occurs, CRS will reduce system levels immediately.**

---

## 3. MAXIMUM LEVELS (STRICT)

- The venue operates under community-safe SPL limits
- CRS staff will monitor levels throughout the event
- Repeated level violations = system muted or event halted

This protects: the Bose/Martin rig, hearing, neighbours, our licence and long-term operation.

---

## 4. ANALOGUE & HERITAGE EQUIPMENT (LOOK, DON'T TOUCH)

The following equipment is heritage-grade and off-limits unless explicitly authorised:
- Neumann U87 / AKG 414 microphones
- Tascam analogue multi-track
- Vintage synths & tape machines
- Legacy outboard and reels

**These are not party props.**

Any unauthorised handling → immediate shutdown + liability.

---

## 5. SIGNAL PATH & NETWORK (NO DIY)

- Dante, SDI, NDI, and Cat6A routing is preconfigured
- External devices must be approved before connection
- No ad-hoc WiFi networks
- No unmanaged switches
- No "it'll probably be fine" moments

**If it wasn't agreed in advance, it doesn't get plugged in.**

---

## 6. CHANGEOVERS & SETUP TIME

- Setup and soundcheck times are agreed in advance
- Overrunning setup cuts into performance time
- CRS is not responsible for rushed sets caused by late arrival

**Professional behaviour is expected.**

---

## 7. DAMAGE & LIABILITY

External promoters are responsible for:
- Damage caused by misuse
- Spilled liquids near equipment
- Unauthorised reconfiguration

**Damage costs will be invoiced at full replacement or repair value.**

---

## 8. THE CORE RULE (READ THIS TWICE)

**This is a studio first, a venue second.**

The system is designed for longevity, quality, and community trust — not chaos.

If your event relies on uncontrolled volume, distorted sound, improvised wiring, or ignoring technical boundaries, **this is not the right venue.**

---

## 9. AGREEMENT

By booking or promoting an event at CRS × Workshop Café, you agree to:
- Follow this policy
- Respect CRS technical authority
- Protect the system for future artists

Failure to comply may result in:
- Reduced system levels
- Early shutdown
- Refusal of future bookings

---

## SUMMARY (FOR PROMOTERS)

- Great sound ≠ loud sound
- Respect the rig
- Respect the room
- Respect the people running it

**CRS staff are happy to collaborate with visiting engineers who respect these boundaries.**

You'll get excellent results if you work with the system, not against it.
