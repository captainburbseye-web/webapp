            Located in the heart of OX4, Cowley Road Studios (CRS) is a multifaceted creative hub dedicated to the craft of sound, technical repair, and community collaboration. We bridge the gap between high-end professional production and accessible local culture.

          <p>
            From the foundations of Backbeat Records and the legendary Soundworks Studio to the reggae energy of Mackating and the original sound systems, our team has been at the heart of Oxford's music scene since the early 90s. De*Gen3 represents the next chapter in this 30-year legacy—a new flagship facility built for the next era of creativity and high-fidelity sound.

      {/* THE CRS STORY */}

        <h3 className="content-heading heading">The CRS Story</h3>
        <div className="content-text">
          <p>
            Cowley Road Studios was founded on a simple premise: <strong>professional infrastructure shouldn't be a luxury</strong>.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            Oxford's creative community needed recording facilities, rehearsal space, and technical support that worked reliably — not aspirational branding or fragile setups. We built CRS to prioritise engineering reality, documentation, and predictable outcomes.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            We began with a single recording room and a commitment to system discipline: signal paths mapped, equipment tested, and decisions made on function rather than fashion.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            Today, CRS operates across two Oxford locations — <strong>Cowley Road</strong> and <strong>Cricket Road</strong> — providing studio recording, rehearsal space, live sound services, and community venue access. We support grassroots artists, community organisations, and professional projects using the same operational standard.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}>
            The mission remains unchanged: <strong>make professional-grade creative infrastructure accessible, reliable, and sustainable</strong>.

        <h3 className="content-heading heading">The No Chaos Policy</h3>
        <div className="content-text">
          <p>
            CRS operates under a strict <strong>No Chaos Policy</strong>. This is not a slogan — it is an operational baseline.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1.5rem' }}><strong>Equipment Maintenance</strong><br/>
            All equipment is tested, maintained, and documented. If it is in use, it works.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}><strong>Signal Path Documentation</strong><br/>
            Studios, PA systems, and installations are fully documented. No undocumented routing. No guesswork.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}><strong>Engineering-Led Decisions</strong><br/>
            Systems and workflows are chosen for reliability and suitability, not trends or brand allegiance.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}><strong>Predictable Results</strong><br/>
            Sessions and events are designed to start on time and run without technical distraction.
          </p>
          <p style={{ marginTop: '1rem' }}><strong>Systematic Problem Solving</strong><br/>
            When issues arise, they are resolved methodically, documented, and prevented from recurring.
