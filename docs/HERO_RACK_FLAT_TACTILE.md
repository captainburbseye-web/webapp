## 🔒 MASTER PROMPT (v1.4)

```
A clean, flat-but-tactile illustrated 16:9 banner depicting a stylised industrial 3U rack façade branded "COWLEY ROAD STUDIOS."

The illustration uses simplified shapes, controlled shading, and reduced colour depth, preserving the weight and authority of industrial studio equipment without photorealistic detail. Materials are suggested rather than rendered: dark charcoal steel panels, muted mustard signage, off-white label plates, and subtle grey accents.

The rack is symmetrical and modular, designed as a symbolic object rather than a machine.

Upper center: two stacked British road-sign style plates with flat colour fills and slight texture grain.
• Top plate: off-white, labeled "COWLEY ROAD" in bold, utilitarian sans-serif type.
• Bottom plate: mustard yellow, labeled "STUDIOS" in heavy black lettering.

Right panel: a yellow diamond sign containing a hand-drawn cricket character holding a guitar, rendered in simple white linework — playful, imperfect, and human, contrasting the rigid industrial geometry.

Lower section: decorative, non-functional hardware elements — simplified rocker switches, flat indicator dots, and static meter faces — illustrated with minimal highlights and shadows to imply depth without realism.

Far right: abstracted vent and heat-sink shapes used purely as visual ballast, drawn with repeating vertical lines or blocks, no cables or connectors.

Lighting is graphic rather than photographic: soft top shading, restrained inner shadows, and consistent edge highlights to create a tactile, screen-print-friendly feel.

The overall style sits between industrial wayfinding graphics, album artwork, and modern brand illustration — authoritative, calm, and institutional.

The object reads as a symbol of creative infrastructure, not a device, not a UI, not a technical diagram.

Vector-friendly, slight grain paper texture, no gradients beyond 2-3 tonal steps, bold outlines only where structurally necessary, flat colour blocks with restrained shadow layers.
```

### Negative Prompt (Critical)

```
photorealism, hyper-detail, 3D render, glossy reflections, sci-fi UI, neon lighting, functional electronics, technical schematics, realism-heavy shading
```
