# 🚫🎛️ CRS × WORKSHOP CAFÉ

## **"NO CHAOS" TECHNICAL POLICY**

*(External Promoters, Engineers & Event Hosts)*

### Status: **ACTIVE — ENFORCED**

Cowley Road Studios & Workshop Café operates a **heritage-forward, precision-calibrated audio-visual system**.  
To protect equipment, neighbours, artists, and long-term system integrity, the following rules apply to **all external events, promoters, DJs, engineers, and collectives**.

---

## 1️⃣ SYSTEM AUTHORITY (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

* **CRS technical staff have final authority** over:
  * PA configuration
  * Gain structure
  * Speaker placement
  * Limiting levels
  * Signal routing
* External engineers **may not override** system settings without approval.

**If CRS technical staff decline a request, that decision is final.**

---

## 2️⃣ FRONT-OF-HOUSE PA (BOSE 802 + MARTIN IC300)

This system is **calibrated for clarity, not brute force**.

### You MAY:

* Plug into designated inputs provided by CRS
* Request minor tonal adjustments
* Use CRS-provided DI / interfaces

### You MAY NOT:

* Bypass limiters
* Repatch amps or processors
* Daisy-chain additional speakers
* Add external subs
* Push system into audible distortion
* "Redline it because it's a party"

**If audible distortion occurs, CRS will reduce system levels immediately.**

---

## 3️⃣ MAXIMUM LEVELS (STRICT)

* The venue operates under **community-safe SPL limits**
* CRS staff will monitor levels throughout the event
* **Repeated level violations = system muted or event halted**

This protects:

* The Bose/Martin rig
* Hearing
* Neighbours
* Our licence and long-term operation

---

## 4️⃣ ANALOGUE & HERITAGE EQUIPMENT (LOOK, DON'T TOUCH)

The following equipment is **heritage-grade** and **off-limits** unless explicitly authorised:

* Neumann U87 / AKG 414 microphones
* Tascam analogue multi-track
* Vintage synths & tape machines
* Legacy outboard and reels

**These are not party props.**

Any unauthorised handling → immediate shutdown + liability.

---

## 5️⃣ SIGNAL PATH & NETWORK (NO DIY)

* Dante, SDI, NDI, and Cat6A routing is **preconfigured**
* External devices **must be approved** before connection
* No ad-hoc WiFi networks
* No unmanaged switches
* No "it'll probably be fine" moments

**If it wasn't agreed in advance, it doesn't get plugged in.**

---

## 6️⃣ CHANGEOVERS & SETUP TIME

* Setup and soundcheck times are **agreed in advance**
* Overrunning setup cuts into performance time
* CRS is not responsible for rushed sets caused by late arrival

**Professional behaviour is expected.**

---

## 7️⃣ DAMAGE & LIABILITY

* External promoters are responsible for:
  * Damage caused by misuse
  * Spilled liquids near equipment
  * Unauthorised reconfiguration

**Damage costs will be invoiced at full replacement or repair value.**

---

## 8️⃣ THE CORE RULE (READ THIS TWICE)

> **This is a studio first, a venue second.**
>
> The system is designed for longevity, quality, and community trust — not chaos.

If your event relies on:

* uncontrolled volume
* distorted sound
* improvised wiring
* ignoring technical boundaries

**This is not the right venue.**

---

## 9️⃣ AGREEMENT

By booking or promoting an event at CRS × Workshop Café, you agree to:

* Follow this policy
* Respect CRS technical authority
* Protect the system for future artists

Failure to comply may result in:

* Reduced system levels
* Early shutdown
* Refusal of future bookings

---

## ✅ SUMMARY (FOR PROMOTERS)

* Great sound ≠ loud sound
* Respect the rig
* Respect the room
* Respect the people running it

**CRS staff are happy to collaborate with visiting engineers who respect these boundaries.**

You'll get **excellent results** if you work *with* the system, not against it.
