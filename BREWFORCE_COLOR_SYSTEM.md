# CRS BREWFORCE CAFÉ

## Colour Brand Sheet

### **Foliage Physics × Flame Physics**

**Canonical — Version 1.0**  
**Date:** 2026-01-08  
**Status:** ✅ Active & Enforced

---

## 1. Core Colour Philosophy (Non-Negotiable)

CRS Brewforce Café colours are derived from **how nature actually behaves**, not aesthetics alone.

* **Foliage** provides structure, calm, and continuity
* **Fire** provides energy, activation, and transformation

Both systems obey **physics rules**, not decoration.

---

## 2. FOLIAGE PHYSICS (Dominant System)

### Principle

> **Green dominates. Brown exists only at points of structure.**

Just like in real foliage:

* You mostly see leaves
* You *occasionally* see bark, soil, or branch

---

### Foliage Colour Roles

| Colour                   | Hex Code | Function                                    | Behaviour         |
| ------------------------ | -------- | ------------------------------------------- | ----------------- |
| **Primary Greens**       | `#4A5B43` (Olive) | Environment, backgrounds, majority surfaces | Dominant (60–75%) |
| **Deep Greens**          | `#2D3A28` (Dark Olive) | Text, anchors, contrast                     | Structural        |
| **Soft Greens / Lichen** | `#8B9B7E` (Soft Sage) | Light backgrounds                           | Breathing space   |
| **Browns**               | `#4B3621` (Espresso) | Grounding, weight, roots                    | Minimal, rare     |

---

### Foliage Usage Rules

* Greens are the **default**
* Browns are:
  - Thin lines
  - Small blocks
  - Text accents
  - Structural dividers
* Never large brown fields
* Never "earthy overload"

**Brown should feel like a tree trunk — not a forest.**

---

## 3. FLAME PHYSICS (Energy System)

### Principle

> **The hottest energy lives at the smallest point.**

Fire is layered, not flat.

---

### Flame Colour Roles

| Layer           | Hex Code | Colour                 | Behaviour           |
| --------------- | -------- | ---------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Core**        | `#6B4FFF` (Electric Purple) | Purple / Electric Blue | Tiny, intense, rare |
| **Inner Flame** | `#FF6B35` (Fire Orange) | Fire Orange            | Directional, active |
| **Outer Flame** | `#D4A437` (Mustard) | Mustard Yellow         | Warm, inviting      |
| **Environment** | `#4A5B43` (Olive) | Greens                 | Containment         |

---

### Flame Usage Rules

* **Purple / Blue**
  - Only once per composition (or not at all)
  - Dot, line, glyph, pulse, underline
  - Never backgrounds
* **Orange / Yellow**
  - Accents, CTAs, emphasis
  - Can be bold, but not dominant
* Fire colours always sit **on green**, never replace it

**Purple/blue are events, not colours.**

---

## 4. Combined System Hierarchy (This Is the Order)

1. **Greens** — life, stability, continuity
2. **Yellow / Orange** — warmth, action, play
3. **Purple / Blue** — peak energy, myth, ignition
4. **Brown** — grounding, structure, roots

If this order is broken, the design is off-brand.

---

## 5. Visual Balance Ratios (Guideline)

These are not strict maths — they're gut checks.

* **Greens:** ~65–75%
* **Yellow / Orange:** ~15–25%
* **Purple / Blue:** ~1–3%
* **Brown:** ~3–6%

If purple or brown feel *noticeable*, they're probably overused.

---

## 6. What This System Avoids (On Purpose)

* Flat colour blocks without hierarchy
* Literal flame gradients
* Muddy "earth tone" overload
* Neon or synthetic colours
* Pastel retro palettes

This keeps the brand:

* Timeless
* Confident
* Physical-space friendly
* Comic-adjacent without cosplay

---

## 7. One-Line Laws (Memorable)

* **Green is the world.**
* **Fire is the signal.**
* **Purple/blue is the core.**
* **Brown is the root.**

If a design follows those four lines, it's on brand.

---

## 8. Design Prompt (Save This)

You can paste this anywhere:

> "Use a foliage-dominant green palette with minimal brown for structure. Fire accents should appear in yellow and orange, with a very small purple or blue element at the core only — like the hottest part of a flame. Colours should feel natural, bold, and intentional, never decorative or overused."

---

## 9. Current Implementation (Cowley Road Studios Website)

### Active Color Palette

| Role | Color Name | Hex Code | Usage |
|------|-----------|----------|-------|
| **Background** | Charcoal | `#1E1E1E` | Primary dark background |
| **Text** | Cream | `#F8F6EE` | Primary body text, high contrast |
| **Primary Accent** | Mustard | `#D4A437` | CTAs, highlights, outer flame |
| **Secondary Accent** | Olive | `#4A5B43` | Buttons, foliage structure |
| **Tertiary** | Espresso | `#4B3621` | Minimal use, grounding |

### Design Philosophy Applied

**Current State:** Dark mode with charcoal background creates the **night forest** environment where fire (mustard CTAs) provides warmth and direction. The olive green appears in structural elements, maintaining foliage dominance through subtle presence rather than coverage.

**Rationale:** Dark background inverts the traditional foliage dominance but maintains the physics - green provides structure (buttons, borders), fire provides energy (mustard CTAs, hover states), and the charcoal acts as the "night soil" - the ground from which everything grows.

### Future Considerations

* **Add Electric Purple/Blue** (`#6B4FFF`) as micro-accent for:
  - Notification dots
  - Active state indicators
  - Special event badges
  - "Core ignition" moments
* **Add Fire Orange** (`#FF6B35`) for:
  - Urgent CTAs
  - Live indicators
  - Energy moments
* **Maintain Foliage Physics** even in dark mode through:
  - Olive structural elements
  - Green hover states
  - Foliage-inspired patterns
