# CRS "NO CHAOS" POLICY — QUICK REFERENCE

**For External Promoters & Engineers**

---

## CORE RULES

1. **CRS technical staff have final authority** — no overrides without approval
2. **Bose 802 + Martin IC300 PA** — calibrated for clarity, not brute force
3. **Community-safe SPL limits** — repeated violations = muted or halted
4. **Heritage equipment off-limits** — U87, 414, Tascam, vintage gear protected
5. **Signal path preconfigured** — Dante/SDI/NDI not to be touched
6. **Setup time agreed in advance** — late arrival = rushed set (your problem)
7. **Damage invoiced at full replacement value** — misuse = liability
8. **This is a studio first, venue second** — designed for longevity, not chaos

---

## YOU MAY:
✅ Plug into designated CRS inputs  
✅ Request minor tonal adjustments  
✅ Use CRS-provided DI/interfaces  

## YOU MAY NOT:
❌ Bypass limiters  
❌ Repatch amps or processors  
❌ Add external subs or speakers  
❌ Push system into distortion  
❌ Touch heritage equipment  
❌ Plug in unapproved devices  

---

## IF YOU:
- Cause audible distortion → CRS reduces levels immediately
- Violate level limits repeatedly → system muted or event halted
- Handle heritage gear without authorisation → immediate shutdown + liability
- Ignore technical boundaries → refusal of future bookings

---

## AGREEMENT

By booking/promoting at CRS × Workshop Café, you agree to:
- Follow this policy
- Respect CRS technical authority
- Protect the system for future artists

---

## SUMMARY

**Great sound ≠ loud sound**

CRS staff are happy to collaborate with visiting engineers who respect these boundaries.

You'll get excellent results if you work *with* the system, not against it.
